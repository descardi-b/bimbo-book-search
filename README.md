## The Bimbo Book Search

Ever hear about a really good book and then totally forget its title? Or author? Or what the plot's even about? Maybe it's all the hairspray, or maybe it's the unbearable burden of your own beauty, but it's getting harder and harder for bimbos to remember things these days! <br/>

That's where the bimbo book search comes in. This handy app lets you save and track your own personal book list for past, present, and future reading pleasure.

### How It Works

The Bimbo Book Search utilizes the following technologies:

* MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js 
* Apollo
* GraphQL
* Bcrypt
* HTMl, CSS, and Javascript

### How To Use It

Simply run the app on <a href="https://salty-mesa-30136.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>.<br/>

Then, create your own account or login. Once you're registered, you can search, add, and remove to your heart's content.
